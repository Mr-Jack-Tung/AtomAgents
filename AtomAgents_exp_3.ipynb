      "1. **General Trend**:\n",
      "   - For all crack systems, the critical fracture toughness (KIc) generally decreases as the Nb concentration increases from 0% to 80%.\n",

      "2. **Specific Crack Systems**:\n",
      "   - **[100][010][001] (Blue Line)**:\n",
      "     - This system shows the highest KIc values at lower Nb concentrations (0% to 40%).\n",
      "     - The KIc decreases significantly from 40% to 80% Nb concentration.\n",
      "     - There is a slight increase in KIc at 100% Nb concentration.\n",
      "   - **[1-10][111][1-12] (Orange Line)**:\n",
      "     - This system has relatively stable KIc values up to 20% Nb concentration.\n",
      "     - The KIc decreases steadily from 20% to 80% Nb concentration.\n",
      "     - A slight increase in KIc is observed at 100% Nb concentration.\n",
      "   - **[111][11-2][-110] (Green Line)**:\n",
      "     - This system shows a similar trend to the orange line, with stable KIc values up to 20% Nb concentration.\n",
      "     - The KIc decreases steadily from 20% to 80% Nb concentration.\n",
      "     - A slight increase in KIc is observed at 100% Nb concentration.\n",
      "   - **[1-1-2][110][1-11] (Red Line)**:\n",

      "     - A slight increase in KIc is observed at 100% Nb concentration.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusions:\n",
      "1. **Preferential Crack Plane**:\n",
      "   - At lower Nb concentrations (0% to 40%), the [100][010][001] crack system exhibits the highest critical fracture toughness, indicating it is the most resistant to fracture.\n",
      "   - At higher Nb concentrations (80% to 100%), the differences in KIc values among the crack systems are less pronounced, but the [100][010][001] system still shows a slight advantage.\n",

      "2. **Effect of Nb Concentration**:\n",
      "   - Increasing Nb concentration generally reduces the critical fracture toughness for all crack systems, with a significant drop observed between 40% and 80% Nb concentration.\n",
      "   - The slight increase in KIc at 100% Nb concentration suggests a possible change in the fracture mechanism or material properties at this composition.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary:\n",
      "- The [100][010][001] crack system is the preferential crack plane at lower Nb concentrations due to its higher critical fracture toughness.\n",
